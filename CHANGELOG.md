# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Releases before this file existed are described on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/oktopeak/clio-mcp/releases) page.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Undeclared arguments were silently dropped, and two of them produced
  defective time entries.** Every tool's input schema was a plain Zod shape,
  and Zod's default for an object is to strip keys it does not know. So a call
  to `log_time_entry` that carried the entry text as `description` (the tool
  only knew `note`) came back `success: true` with a blank entry in Clio, and
  a call carrying `utbms_task_code` / `utbms_activity_code` came back
  `success: true` with no codes attached. Reported after a session created ten
  such entries (five blank, five uncoded) before finding the working shape.
  The registry now wraps every tool's schema in a strict object, so an
  unrecognised argument fails the call with an `Unrecognized key` error
  before anything is sent to Clio. This applies to all 39 tools.
- `quantity_in_hours` is rounded to whole seconds before it is sent (1.1 h
  used to go out as 3960.0000000000005).

### Added
- **`note` has an alias, `description`**, on `log_time_entry`,
  `update_time_entry` and `create_activity`. Either works; both with
  different values is an error.
- **UTBMS codes on time entries.** Clio attaches UTBMS codes only through a
  saved activity description that carries the task/activity pair; raw codes
  on the activity body are ignored. `log_time_entry`, `update_time_entry` and
  `create_activity` accept `utbms_task_code` and `utbms_activity_code`,
  resolve them against the account's activity descriptions, and send the
  matching `activity_description_id`. No match, or more than one, is an error
  that names the candidates, and nothing is written. Verified against the
  code, **not yet against a live account**: the association names
  `utbms_task` and `utbms_activity` on `/activity_descriptions.json` come
  from Clio's API reference.
- **`list_activity_descriptions`** lists the saved activity descriptions with
  their UTBMS codes and supports filtering by either code.
- **`update_time_entry`** changes the note, hours, date, rate, billing flags,
  activity description, matter or user on an existing time entry.
- **`delete_time_entry`** removes a time entry. It reads the activity first
  and refuses anything that is not a `TimeEntry` or that is already on a
  bill, so expenses and costs still cannot be deleted through the connector.
  Marked `destructiveHint: true`, hidden by `READ_ONLY`, audit-logged.
- Time entry responses now echo `note`, `non_billable`, `no_charge` and
  `activity_description` so a caller can confirm an entry is not blank.
- `log_time_entry`'s description now states the parameter name and type for
  hours (`quantity_in_hours`, a JSON number).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-09-07

Matter stages and `create_custom_field`, previously staged and unverified,
have now been exercised end-to-end against a live Clio account (EU region),
alongside three bugs the same pass turned up. Each item below says what was
confirmed against that account rather than inferred from Clio's docs.

### Added
- **Matter stages.** `list_matter_stages` returns the firm's own pipeline
  (Pre-Suit, Discovery, Settlement) grouped by practice area and in order, and
  `matter_stage` now comes back on `list_matters` and `get_matter` while
  `matter_stage_id` can be set through `create_matter` and `update_matter`.
  Confirmed live, including that Clio requires `practice_area_id` to already
  match the stage's practice area on a write — setting a stage from a
  different practice area fails cleanly with a 422 rather than silently
  applying. For most firms the stage is the field that says what a matter
  needs next. Clio can attach workflows and task lists to a stage; whether an
  API-driven stage change fires them is **not verified** and the tool
  descriptions say so rather than implying it works.
- **`create_custom_field`** creates a new custom field definition (Matter or
  Contact) on the connected account, closing the gap where the connector could
  only set values on fields that already existed. The returned `id` works
  immediately as `custom_field_id` in `create_matter` / `update_matter`,
  confirmed live for all seven field types including picklist. A 403 from it
  is explained the same way `list_custom_fields` explains one.

### Fixed
- **Ten write tools reported writes that had actually succeeded as if they'd
  failed.** `clioPost`/`clioPatch` never accepted a `fields` query parameter,
  so every write endpoint fell back to Clio's minimal default response and
  handlers reading back nested fields (`client`, `practice_area`,
  `matter_stage`, `custom_fields`, and similar) got `undefined` instead of the
  real values. The underlying write was correct every time — only each tool's
  own confirmation was wrong. Affects `create_matter`, `update_matter`,
  `create_custom_field`, `create_note`, `create_calendar_entry`,
  `log_time_entry`, `create_activity`, `create_task`, `update_task`,
  `complete_task`.
- **`list_matter_relationships` failed on every call.** It requested a bare
  `type` field that Clio's API rejects outright (`400 ... type is not a valid
  field`), so the tool never returned data. `description` is the field that
  actually carries the relationship's role label; `type` is no longer
  requested.
- **`create_folder`'s `if_not_exists` could create a duplicate.** It looked up
  an existing folder by name using Clio's `query=` search parameter, which
  lags a few seconds behind a just-created folder. Calling `create_folder`
  twice in quick succession with `if_not_exists: true` could create two
  folders with the same name. The lookup now lists the parent folder's
  contents directly and matches the name client-side instead of relying on
  the search index.
- README and `server.json` said 34 tools and undercounted the write tools;
  the connector exposes 36 tools (24 read / 12 write), and the read-only-mode
  documentation now lists all twelve write tools it hides.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-09-07

A hotfix. 2.2.0 could not read a matter or a contact at all, and it was the
default install for five days.

### Fixed
- **Every matter and contact read returned a Clio 400.** `list_matters`,
  `get_matter`, `search_contacts`, `get_contact` and the read-back inside
  `create_matter` and `update_matter` all embed one shared `fields` string, and
  that string asked for `custom_field_values{...,custom_field{id},picklist_option{id,option}}`.
  Clio does not accept a second level of brace nesting there and answered
  `400 ... picklist_option} is not a valid field` for the whole request. Both
  associations are now requested bare. Reported by a firm running 2.2.0 against
  a live account on the day it shipped, with the cause correctly diagnosed;
  thank you.
- **A picklist can no longer be shown as its option id.** Clio returns the
  selected option's id in `value`, and whether the label arrives alongside it
  depends on behaviour we cannot verify without a live account. So the label is
  taken from the response when it is there, otherwise from one read of the field
  definitions, and if neither works `display_value` is `null` with
  `label_unresolved: true` rather than a number a lawyer has never seen. The
  definitions are read once per response, only when something needs it, and are
  deliberately not cached across calls because the HTTP transport is
  multi-tenant.
- **A rejected `fields` string now costs one column instead of the connector.**
  Reads retry once without the optional expansions and return a
  `fields_warning` saying the missing fields are missing rather than empty.
  Reads that feed a write keep failing loudly, because silently dropping the
  expansion there would change what gets written.
- **Custom field values that come back stripped are now called out.** On some
  accounts Clio returns the value's id with `name`, `type` and `value` all null
  and no error, and the same accounts get a 403 from `/custom_fields.json`.
  Responses carry a `custom_fields_warning`, and `list_custom_fields` explains
  the 403 instead of passing Clio's wording through on its own. The cause is
  **not confirmed** and the README says so; if you hit it, please open an issue.
- **`matter_activity_summary` fails with advice instead of timing out.** Each of
  its five account-wide reads now has a page budget, so a book too large for the
  requested window says which arguments to narrow rather than exceeding the MCP
  client's request timeout with no output. `lookback_days` is capped at 365 for
  the same reason, and its description now explains that staleness follows a
  note's own date rather than its import date.
- README said the read-only mode hides "nine" write tools. It hides eleven, and
  the list was missing `update_matter` and `create_folder`.

### Internal
- The audit-log privacy sweep now derives its arguments from each tool's own
  input schema and runs against every tool the registry exposes, instead of a
  hand-written list that a new tool could silently miss.
- The README's per-section tool counts, the count in the npm description and the
  read-only write-tool count are checked against the registry in CI. That number
  has been published wrong three times.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-02

Two things a firm's IT or security reviewer asks for, and one that an App
Directory listing needs.

Promoted to `latest`. Until now the default install was 2.0.1, which is the
release that writes note subjects, contact search queries and custom field
values into `~/.clio-mcp/audit.log` in plain text. Leaving that as the version
new users get by default was the worse of the two risks.

This has not been exercised against a live Clio account on our side. Every tool
is covered by unit tests and the stdio handshake is verified in all three modes,
but the first real Clio data it sees will be yours. Report anything that looks
wrong and we will turn it around quickly.

### Added
- **Read-only mode.** `READ_ONLY=true` removes every write tool from the
  server entirely, so they are not present to be approved rather than being
  refused when called. The distinction matters: until now the only thing
  standing between a connector and a write was the MCP client's own approval
  prompt, which belongs to the client and not to us.
- **Tool registry.** A single `registerAllTools` used by stdio, the built-in
  HTTP transport, and library consumers, which also injects a title and MCP
  annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`) on every
  tool. A tool missing from the registry is treated as a write tool, so
  forgetting to classify a new one fails closed.
- **Library mode.** `@oktopeak/clio-mcp/lib` exports the Clio OAuth flow and
  the registry with typings, for hosts that embed the connector and manage
  their own sessions rather than shelling out to the binary.
- **Broker OAuth mode.** With `TOKEN_BROKER_URL` set instead of
  `CLIO_CLIENT_ID` / `CLIO_CLIENT_SECRET`, the connector holds no client
  secret at all: it keeps a PKCE verifier locally and a hosted broker performs
  the token exchange. This is what a one-click Clio App Directory install
  needs. Startup validation knows which credentials each mode requires.
- `SECURITY.md` and a security contact.
- CI on every push and pull request, Node 20 and 22: build, type check, tests,
  and a check that no secret ever reaches a published tarball.

### Changed
- **Audit arguments are now allowlisted rather than denylisted.** Only the
  keys named per tool are written verbatim; anything else present becomes
  `[redacted]`, and an unknown tool has every key redacted. The previous
  approach masked a fixed list of secret names and copied everything else
  through, which is the wrong default for a log that sits next to client data.
- `DERIVED_AUDIT_KEYS` records the one deliberate exception: a tool may log a
  summary of an argument rather than the argument, as `update_matter` logs
  which custom fields it touched without logging what they were set to. Tests
  require every such key to be id- or count-shaped and to actually be used.


## [2.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-09-01

Custom fields and notes are the two things firms asked for most often, and the two
that a practice-management connector is least useful without: on a generalist
platform like Clio, the case-specific facts a firm vets on live in custom fields,
and the narrative lives in notes. This release reads both, writes custom fields
back, and adds a one-call activity sweep across the open book.

Not yet exercised against a live Clio account. Published under the `beta` tag for
that reason; `latest` stays on 2.0.1.

### Added
- **Custom field values on matters and contacts.** `list_matters`, `get_matter`,
  `search_contacts` and `get_contact` return a `custom_fields` array with the
  field name, its type, the raw value, and a `display_value`. Picklist fields
  resolve to the option label: Clio returns the option *id* in `value`, so a
  connector that does not request `picklist_option{id,option}` hands back a
  meaningless number.
- **`list_custom_fields`** lists the account's field definitions with their types
  and, for picklists, their allowed options. Call it before reading or writing
  custom fields.
- **`update_matter`** updates an existing matter, custom fields included. Clio
  addresses an existing value by its own composite id and a new one by the field
  definition id, so the tool reads the record first and picks the right shape per
  field. Values can also be cleared.
- **`create_matter`** accepts `custom_field_values`.
- **`list_notes`** for matters and contacts, with pagination, the note's own
  `date`, `created_since`/`updated_since` filters, and rich-text notes converted
  to plain text (the original markup stays on `detail_html`).
- **`list_matter_relationships`** returns the contacts attached to a matter and
  the role each plays: co-counsel, expert, fact witness, opposing counsel.
- **`matter_activity_summary`** gives last note, last time entry, next calendar
  entry, open task count and days since anything happened, for every open matter
  in one call, sorted with the quietest first. It reads each collection once
  account-wide rather than once per matter, so the cost does not scale with the
  size of the book.
- **Folders:** `list_folders`, `folder_exists` and `create_folder`.
  `folder_exists` paginates to completion and never filters on parent type, both
  of which produce false negatives; `create_folder` takes `if_not_exists`, which
  performs that check inside the call so a repeated bulk run cannot create
  duplicates.
- `maildrop_address` on `get_matter`.
- `page_token` on `list_matters`, `list_tasks` and `list_users`.
- `clioGetAllPages`, a paginate-to-completion helper for reads where a partial
  answer is a wrong answer. It throws rather than silently truncating.
- CI on every push and pull request (Node 20 and 22): tests plus a type check.

### Fixed
- **The audit log no longer records client data.** Custom field values, note
  subjects, matter descriptions, contact search queries and folder names were
  written to `~/.clio-mcp/audit.log` in plain text. Entries now carry ids,
  counts and filters, which is what an access log needs, and a test sweeps every
  tool to keep it that way.
- **`list_notes` sent a capitalized `type` filter, which Clio rejects with 422.**
  The GET filter takes `matter` or `contact`; the capitalized form belongs to the
  note body when creating one.
- `list_notes` now rejects being given both `matter_id` and `contact_id` instead
  of quietly sending both filters.
- `get_billing_summary` paginates, so a matter with more than one page of bills
  no longer under-reports its outstanding balance.
- `Retry-After` is parsed per RFC 7231. An HTTP-date value previously produced
  `NaN` and retried immediately, which turned rate-limit handling into a retry
  storm. Backoff is now jittered and capped, with a total wait budget, and the
  client slows down as `X-RateLimit-Remaining` approaches zero rather than
  waiting to be refused.

### Changed
- `list_matters`, `list_tasks` and `list_users` return a paginated envelope
  (`total_count`, `has_more`, `next_page_token`) instead of a bare array.


### Added
- `READ_ONLY=true|1|yes` leaves the nine write tools unregistered on both transports, so Claude can read Clio but never change it. A server-side guarantee: the tools are absent from `tools/list` and a call to one is rejected.
- Every tool now carries a `title` and MCP annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint`).
- `src/tools/index.ts`: one registry (`registerAllTools`, `TOOL_META`, `WRITE_TOOLS`) used by the stdio and HTTP entry points; new tools must be listed there (`registry.test.ts` enforces it).
- `SECURITY.md` with the reporting address, response times and scope.
- Audit log: `user_id` and `request_id` fields for hosted deployments; `configureAudit({ sink, redact })` lets a host replace the file with its own store; `readAuditLog` accepts `user_id` and `session_id` filters.
- **Library entry point** `@oktopeak/clio-mcp/lib` (also the package default export) with typings: the tool registry, the session-context seam (`runWithSessionContext`, `requireSessionContext`), the audit sink, pure Clio OAuth functions that take explicit credentials and a region (`buildClioAuthorizeUrl`, `exchangeClioCode`, `refreshClioTokens`, `fetchClioWhoAmI`) with PKCE helpers, region helpers that accept a region code, and the Clio HTTP client. See "Using the connector as a library" in the README.
- `registerAllTools` options `exclude` and `complianceNotice`; `registerResources(server, { complianceNotice })`.
- CI workflow (Node 20 and 22: build, test, secret scan) and `npm run verify:no-secrets`, which now also runs in `prepublishOnly`.
- `CLIO_REGION` now accepts `au` (https://au.app.clio.com) and `ca` (https://ca.app.clio.com) in addition to `us` and `eu`, for both the API base URL and the OAuth authorize/token URLs. The region-to-hostname map lives in one place (`src/utils/clioRegion.ts`) and is imported by the API client, the OAuth flow, and the HTTP server.
- `MCP_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true` opt-out for local development of the HTTP transport. Prints a loud warning at startup; must never be used on a public host.
- Unit tests for the region map, the OAuth URLs per region, and HTTP authentication (startup validation and the per-route gate).

### Changed
- **Audit log arguments are now recorded by allowlist.** For each tool only ids, limits, dates, page tokens, enums and booleans are written verbatim; every other argument that was passed appears as `"[redacted]"`. Contact and document search queries, note subjects and bodies, task names and descriptions, calendar summaries, descriptions and locations, matter descriptions and client references, time-entry and activity notes, file paths and file names, and the `list_users` name filter no longer reach the log.
- `machine_ip` is written in stdio mode only; in HTTP mode (typically a container) it is omitted.
- `SessionContext.getTokens`, `storeTokens` and `clearTokens` are now async and `setPendingNonce` is optional (only affects code that embeds the connector; the stdio and HTTP modes behave as before). Outside stdio mode a missing session context is now an error instead of a silent fall back to the shared token file.
- HTTP mode refreshes an expiring Clio token once per session even when several tool calls arrive at the same time; stdio mode coalesces concurrent `getValidAccessToken` calls the same way.
- `package.json` `main`/`exports` point at the library entry; the `clio-mcp` binary is unchanged.
- README: the compliance section now states the real write surface (nine write tools, all logged, all removable with `READ_ONLY`) instead of claiming the connector cannot create matters or calendar entries.
- **Breaking for HTTP mode:** `MCP_API_KEY` is now required when `TRANSPORT=http`. The server refuses to start if the key is missing or shorter than 24 characters. stdio mode is unaffected.
- The API key check now applies to every HTTP route except `/health` and `/oauth/callback`: all methods on `/mcp` (POST, GET/SSE stream, DELETE) and any unknown path return `401` without a valid key. The comparison is constant-time.
- An unknown `CLIO_REGION` value now stops startup with an error listing the valid values instead of silently using the US endpoint.
- Blank `CLIO_API_BASE`, `CLIO_AUTH_URL`, and `CLIO_TOKEN_URL` values are treated as unset instead of producing broken URLs.

### Fixed
- README: the regions text lists all four Clio data regions with exact hostnames and explains that the region is fixed at Clio account creation and must match the firm's Clio server.
- README: the HTTP mode section documents the required key and the dev-only opt-out.
- README: the stale `@1.0.1` version pin example now uses the current release.
- README: Trust Model wording on zero-data-retention (available on the Anthropic API at the organization level; Claude Enterprise is one option, not the only one) plus a model-version caveat.
- README: em-dashes removed throughout.
- `server.json` and `.env.example` describe all four regions and the HTTP API key.
