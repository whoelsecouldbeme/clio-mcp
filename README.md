Open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) connector that lets Claude read live data from [Clio](https://www.clio.com) (matters, custom fields, notes, contacts, documents, folders, tasks, calendar, and billing) without copying client information into chat windows. Built for law firms that care about attorney-client privilege, ABA Opinion 512 compliance, and keeping AI workflows inside their existing practice management stack.

> **TL;DR:** 38 Clio tools exposed to Claude across stdio and HTTP/SSE transports. Audit-logged for ABA Opinion 512. OAuth tokens encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. Local-only by default: you register your own Clio developer app, and no relay server sits in between. A separate one-click "listed" variant for the Clio App Directory uses a minimal login-only broker instead, see [Listed / one-click install variant](#listed--one-click-install-variant-app-directory). MIT license, free forever.

**Who this is for:** Law firm IT, legal operations teams, tech-forward partners, and engineers at legal tech companies. If you can follow a five-step terminal install, you can use this.

> [!TIP]
> **Not a developer? You don't need to be.**
>
> The README below assumes someone comfortable editing a JSON config file. If that's not you or your team, we deploy this for law firms: scoped credentials, audit log wired in, one custom workflow, training. A simpler one-command installer is also planned for v0.2.

## Upgrading to 2.2.0

If you installed before September 2026 you are on 2.0.1, and there is one reason to upgrade that is worth stating plainly rather than burying in a changelog.

**2.0.1 writes client data to its audit log.** Contact search queries, note subjects, matter descriptions and custom field values were all recorded verbatim in `~/.clio-mcp/audit.log`. The log is a plain file that nothing rotates. In 2.2.0 audit entries carry ids, counts, dates and page tokens only, enforced by an allowlist rather than a denylist, with a test that fails if any tool ever starts logging content again.

```bash
npm install -g @oktopeak/clio-mcp@2.2.0   # or just restart Claude Desktop if you use npx
```

Your existing `~/.clio-mcp/audit.log` still contains whatever the old version put there. It is worth reading before you decide what to do with it.

Also new since 2.0.1: custom fields and notes on matters and contacts, folder tools, matter relationships, a one-call activity summary across open matters, a config-level `READ_ONLY` mode, and full pagination on reads where a short answer would be a wrong one. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Compliance & Security

This section exists because law firms evaluating AI tools have asked the right questions. Here are direct answers.

### ABA Formal Opinion 512: AI and competence

ABA Opinion 512 (2023) requires attorneys using AI tools to understand how those tools work, supervise their outputs, and maintain confidentiality of client information. This connector is designed with those obligations in mind:

- **Audit log.** Every tool call (every time Claude queries Clio on your behalf) is appended to a local log file at `~/.clio-mcp/audit.log`. Each entry records the timestamp, which tool was invoked, what arguments were passed, whether it succeeded, and the Clio user ID. The log is stored on your machine, not in any cloud service. It is append-only and never purged by the software, so your firm retains a complete record of AI-initiated data access.

- **No data retention by the connector.** The connector does not store matter data, client names, or any Clio content. It fetches from the API and passes results to Claude. The only thing persisted locally is your authentication token, and that is encrypted (see below).

- **Twelve write tools, all logged, all optional.** The connector can create matters, custom fields, notes, tasks, folders, calendar entries, time entries and activities, update matters and tasks, complete tasks, and upload documents. It never deletes anything and never touches contacts or billing records. Every write is recorded in the audit log, and `READ_ONLY=true` removes all twelve write tools from the server entirely (see [Read-only mode](#read-only-mode)), so a firm can start with read access and turn writes on when it has decided to.

### Token security: encryption at rest

Your OAuth credentials are never stored in plain text. After you authenticate, the connector encrypts your access token and refresh token using **AES-256-GCM**, the same standard used by financial institutions, and writes the ciphertext to `~/.clio-mcp/tokens.enc`. The encryption key is auto-generated on first run and stored in your OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux Secret Service), never on the filesystem in plaintext.

If someone obtained the token file without the key, they would not be able to read it.

### OAuth 2.0: no passwords stored

Authentication uses Clio's standard OAuth 2.0 flow. You log in through your browser on Clio's own login page. The connector never sees or handles your Clio password. CSRF protection is implemented via a cryptographic state parameter on every auth request.

### Local-first architecture

The connector runs entirely on your machine. There is no Clio MCP cloud service, no relay server, no third party in the middle. Your Clio API traffic goes directly from your device to Clio's servers.

This is true for the default setup below, where you register your own Clio developer application. The one-click "listed" install variant (next section) is the one exception, and only for the login step.

### Listed / one-click install variant (App Directory)

If you installed this connector via the Clio App Directory's one-click install instead of registering your own Clio developer application, you're using the *listed variant*. It uses one Clio application owned by Oktopeak, shared across every installing firm, instead of a separate application per firm. That means the application's `client_secret` cannot be distributed to your machine — it lives only on a small hosted token broker Oktopeak operates.

**What that changes, precisely:** matter data flows directly between your machine and Clio; only the login handshake passes through our token service. Every tool call — matters, contacts, documents, tasks, calendar, billing, everything — still goes directly from your machine to Clio's API, exactly as in the BYOC setup above. The broker never sees, stores, or logs any of it; it is only involved for the few seconds it takes to complete the OAuth login (and again, briefly, on token refresh). It stores nothing durable — no tokens, no session data survive past that single handshake.

Full data-flow documentation for security reviewers, including a sequence diagram and what the broker persists versus never persists, is in the token broker's repository: [`docs/DATA_FLOW.md`](https://github.com/oktopeak/clio-mcp-backend/blob/main/docs/DATA_FLOW.md).

Everything else — local AES-256-GCM token encryption, the audit log, and the 26 tools — is identical to the BYOC setup. Note that Clio's OAuth doesn't support requesting a narrower scope per login; the permissions your token carries are whatever the connecting Clio application was granted when it was registered in the Clio Developer Portal. For the listed app, that registration is kept to the minimum permission set the 26 tools need — the same principle you'd apply yourself when registering your own app for the BYOC setup. See [Option C](#option-c--one-click-via-clio-app-directory) below for the resulting Claude Desktop config.

## Trust Model

Three questions practitioners evaluating an AI tool for sensitive legal work should ask before installing.

### Which Claude tier should we use?

The connector secures the transport between Clio and Claude. It does NOT change what Claude itself does with data once data enters a conversation. **Claude's data handling depends on the tier you use, not on this connector.**

- **Anthropic API with zero-data-retention (ZDR)**: no-training, no-retention terms, enabled at the organization level on the Anthropic API. A small firm can obtain it; it is not reserved for large enterprise contracts. **This is the configuration we recommend for any work involving privileged client data.**
- **Claude Enterprise / Team**: explicit no-training guarantees, with ZDR available as an option. One way to get the configuration above, suited to firms that want a managed workspace rather than an API integration. Claude Enterprise is one option, not the only one.
- **Claude Pro / Max (consumer)**: Anthropic does not train on consumer chat data by default and human review for safety is limited. Acceptable for non-privileged exploration. **Not a substitute for a zero-data-retention deployment when handling client matter data.**

If you are deploying this connector at a firm, pair it with a zero-data-retention configuration (the Anthropic API with ZDR at the organization level, or Claude Enterprise with ZDR). If you are an individual lawyer testing it on personal or non-privileged data, Claude Pro is reasonable for the testing phase but should not become the long-term setup for client work.

One caveat on model choice: the no-retention default is model-dependent. The newest and most capable model may require retention and opt-in review, so pin the model deliberately and re-check the retention terms on every vendor release.

### Access vs retention: the distinction most evaluations miss

A common assumption is that logging equals compliance: if there is a record of what was accessed, the firm is covered. That conflates two separate things, and the gap between them is where privileged content gets exposed.

- **Retention** is what happens to the data *after* the request: whether it persists in training sets, vendor logs, or any system once the answer is returned.
- **Access** is whether the model saw the matter content *at all*, even ephemerally, in-flight, only to produce its answer.

For privileged matter content, **access is the exposure.** The moment privileged content enters a conversation, the model has processed it, whether or not anything is retained afterward. No-retention and no-training guarantees constrain what happens to the data later; they do not undo the fact that it was seen, and the firm's audit log records only that access happened, not that it was permissible.

This is why tier choice is not optional for privileged work. **Zero-data-retention is the only clean answer for anything touching privileged matter content**, whether you obtain it on the Anthropic API at the organization level or through Claude Enterprise: it is the configuration where the content is processed under contractual no-training, no-retention terms rather than consumer ones. If the matter is privileged and you are not on a ZDR configuration (or a local model, see below), assume the content has been exposed under terms your firm has not vetted.

The connector's own no-retention posture (it stores nothing but your encrypted token) covers the transport layer only. It says nothing about what the model tier does with content once that content enters the conversation. That second question is the one this section answers, and it is the one your firm has to answer before privileged data ever reaches Claude.

### Supply-chain trust (npm package)

The connector ships as `@oktopeak/clio-mcp` on npm. Like every npm package, the published version can be updated at any time by the maintainer. Standard hygiene applies:

- **Pin versions in production.** Use an exact version such as `@oktopeak/clio-mcp@2.2.0` (the current release in `package.json`) rather than a range like `^2.0.0`. Audit before upgrading.
- **Review the diff.** Every release is a tagged commit on GitHub. Verify changes before pulling a new version into a firm-wide deployment.
- **Build from source.** If your firm requires it, clone the repo, audit the code, run from your own build artifact. We do not gate any feature behind the npm distribution.
- **Maintainers.** Published by [Oktopeak](https://oktopeak.com), a public team with public commits and a public npm publisher account. Not anonymous. We respond to security reports at `office@oktopeak.com`.

### What is encrypted, what is not

To pre-empt a common misread:

- **OAuth tokens** (your Clio access + refresh token) are encrypted with AES-256-GCM at rest in `~/.clio-mcp/tokens.enc`. They cannot be read without the encryption key.
- **The encryption key itself** is auto-generated on first run and stored in the OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or Linux Secret Service). It never touches the filesystem in plaintext. For CI/headless installs without a keychain, you can override this by setting `ENCRYPTION_KEY` as a 64-character hex string in your environment.
- **Audit log entries** at `~/.clio-mcp/audit.log` are not encrypted. They contain metadata (timestamps, tool names, parameters with secrets redacted), not Clio content.

## Running with a local model (no third-party processor)

After the SDNY ruling in [*United States v. Heppner*](https://harvardlawreview.org/blog/2026/03/united-states-v-heppner/) (Feb 2026) that consumer Claude is not protected by attorney-client privilege, some firms want a deployment with **no third-party AI processor at all**: model inference running entirely on the firm's own hardware.

This connector supports that out of the box. MCP is a protocol, not a Claude-specific feature. The same connector that talks to Claude Desktop also talks to:

- **[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai)** running Llama 4 70B / DeepSeek V4 / Mistral Large locally (recommended primary path)
- **[Continue.dev](https://continue.dev)** + [Ollama](https://ollama.com) + a bridge ([`mcphost`](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcphost) or [`ollama-mcp-bridge`](https://github.com/patruff/ollama-mcp-bridge))
- Any other MCP-compatible client

## What you can do

Once connected, you can ask Claude things like:

**Matters**
- *"Show me all open matters for Acme Corp"*
- *"What's the status of matter 2024-0042?"*
- *"List my pending matters from the last quarter"*
- *"Open a new matter for Acme Corp: litigation, responsible attorney John Smith"*

**Contacts**
- *"Find the contact details for Jane Smith"*
- *"What's the email address and phone number for client ID 8821?"*
- *"Show me all contacts matching 'Acme', and fetch the next page if there are more"*

**Documents**
- *"List all documents on matter 4821"*
- *"Get the download link for document 9934"*
- *"Find all documents named 'retainer' across all matters"*

**Tasks**
- *"What tasks are due this week on matter 4821?"*
- *"Show me all high-priority incomplete tasks"*
- *"Create a task on matter 4821 to file the motion by Friday, high priority"*

**Notes**
- *"Add a note to matter 4821: initial consultation completed, client confirmed retainer"*
- *"Create a note on this matter summarising today's call with the client"*

**Calendar**
- *"What do I have scheduled between April 28 and May 2?"*
- *"List all calendar entries for next week"*
- *"Show me my available calendars"*
- *"Add a court hearing for matter 4821 on June 10 at 9am"*

**Time entries**
- *"How many hours have been logged on matter 4821 this month?"*
- *"Show me all time entries between April 1 and April 30"*

**Billing**
- *"What's the outstanding balance on matter 4821?"*
- *"When was the last invoice issued for this matter?"*

**Users**
- *"List all attorneys in the firm"*
- *"What's the user ID for Jane Smith?"*
- *"Show me all staff members"*

The connector retrieves live data from Clio on every request. Nothing is cached or stored by the AI.

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18 or later**: [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- **Claude Desktop**: [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download)
- **A Clio account** with permission to create developer applications (ask your Clio administrator if you are unsure)

---

## Setup

**5 steps. 10-15 minutes the first time.** You'll register a Clio Developer App, add one JSON block to your Claude Desktop config, and run an OAuth login. The encryption key is generated automatically; no manual key handling.

Before you run any of this in production, read the [Compliance & Security](#compliance--security) and [Trust Model](#trust-model) sections above. If you are deploying for a firm, pair the connector with a zero-data-retention configuration (the Anthropic API with ZDR at the organization level, or Claude Enterprise); see "Which Claude tier should we use?" above.

### Step 1: Clone and build

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oktopeak/clio-mcp.git
cd clio-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

Note the full path to the folder you just cloned; you will need it in Step 3.

```bash
# On Mac/Linux, print the full path:
pwd

# Example output: /Users/yourname/clio-mcp
```

### Step 2: Create a Clio API application

1. Go to **[developers.clio.com](https://developers.clio.com)** and sign in with your Clio login
2. Click **Developer Apps → Add**
3. Give it a name (e.g., *Claude Connector*)
4. Set the redirect URI to exactly: `http://127.0.0.1:5678/callback`
5. Save the application
6. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**; you will need them in the next step

### Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop

As of v2.0.0 the connector supports two transports: **stdio** (the connector runs as a child process of Claude Desktop, single-user) and **HTTP/SSE** (the connector runs as a standalone server, supports multiple sessions and remote access). Pick one.

Open your Claude Desktop configuration file:

- **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

#### Option A: stdio (simplest, single-user)

Add the following block inside the `"mcpServers"` section, replacing the placeholder values with your own:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clio": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/clio-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "CLIO_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
        "CLIO_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/FULL/PATH/TO/clio-mcp` with the path you noted in Step 1 (e.g., `/Users/yourname/clio-mcp`). `TRANSPORT=stdio` is required because the connector defaults to HTTP mode at v2.0.0.

#### Option B: HTTP/SSE (standalone server, multi-session)

Start the connector as a long-running server. **In HTTP mode an API key is required.** The server refuses to start unless `MCP_API_KEY` is set to a secret of at least 24 characters. Generate one first, then start the server. In a terminal, from the `clio-mcp` directory:

```bash
# Generate a key once and keep it somewhere safe
openssl rand -hex 32

TRANSPORT=http MCP_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000 MCP_API_KEY=<the key you generated> \
CLIO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id CLIO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret \
node build/index.js
```

Then point Claude Desktop at it via the [`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) bridge, passing the same key as a bearer token. (`mcp-remote` recommends the `${AUTH_HEADER}` form because Claude Desktop does not handle spaces inside `args` reliably.)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clio": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp", "--header", "Authorization:${AUTH_HEADER}"],
      "env": { "AUTH_HEADER": "Bearer <the key you generated>" }
    }
  }
}
```

Every route that reaches the MCP server returns `401 Unauthorized` without the key: all methods on `/mcp` (POST, the GET/SSE stream, DELETE) and any unknown path. Only `/health` and the OAuth redirect target `/oauth/callback` are reachable without it, because Clio's browser redirect cannot carry a bearer token.

**Local development only:** if you need to run the HTTP server without a key on your own machine, set `MCP_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true`. The server starts with a loud warning and every route is open. Never use this on a public host or anywhere other people can reach the port; anyone who can reach the endpoint can drive the connector with your Clio access.

#### Option C — One-click via Clio App Directory

If you installed via the Clio App Directory, there's no developer application to register and no `CLIO_CLIENT_SECRET` to handle — the installer configures this for you. The resulting config uses `TOKEN_BROKER_URL` in place of `CLIO_CLIENT_ID`/`CLIO_CLIENT_SECRET`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clio": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/clio-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "TOKEN_BROKER_URL": "https://broker.oktopeak.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See [Listed / one-click install variant](#listed--one-click-install-variant-app-directory) above for what this changes about the data flow.

---

If the file already has other MCP servers configured, add a comma after the last entry and then add the `"clio"` block.

**Using Clio EU, Australia, or Canada?** Set `CLIO_REGION` to `eu`, `au`, or `ca` (the default is `us`). Clio assigns the region when the account is created, and the value must match the Clio server your firm logs in to: `app.clio.com` (us), `eu.app.clio.com` (eu), `au.app.clio.com` (au), or `ca.app.clio.com` (ca). Check the hostname in your browser after logging in to Clio, or contact Clio support if you are unsure. See [Clio regions](#clio-regions) below for the full table.

### Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop

Quit Claude Desktop completely and reopen it.

> [!TIP]
> **On Windows?** The same Windows-specific gotchas that hit our MyCase MCP install also hit Clio MCP: `Could not attach to MCP server` (direct npx invocation), `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE` (corporate antivirus SSL inspection), and OAuth redirect port mismatches. The fixes (`cmd /c npx` wrapper, `NODE_OPTIONS=--use-system-ca`, port matching) are documented in our companion install guide.

### Step 5: Authenticate with Clio

In a new Claude conversation, type:

```
authenticate with Clio
```

Claude will open your browser to Clio's login page. Log in normally. When you see *"Authentication successful"*, return to Claude. You are connected.

To confirm everything is working, type:

```
check my Clio auth status
```

You should see your Clio user ID and token expiry time.

## Available tools

Claude selects and calls these tools automatically based on your questions. You do not need to invoke them by name.

### Auth (3 tools)

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `authenticate` | Opens your browser to Clio's login page and stores your credentials securely |
| `auth_status` | Shows whether you are currently authenticated and when your session expires |
| `logout` | Clears your stored credentials from this machine |

### Matters (4 tools)

| Tool | Inputs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `list_matters` | `status` (open/pending/closed), `limit`, `page_token` | Lists matters with optional status filter, including custom field values; returns a paginated envelope with `total_count`, `has_more`, and `next_page_token` |
| `get_matter` | `matter_id` | Returns full detail for a specific matter, including its Maildrop forwarding address and custom field values |
| `create_matter` | `client_id`, `description`, `status`, `open_date`, `practice_area_id`, `billable`, `responsible_attorney_id`, `originating_attorney_id`, `client_reference`, `custom_field_values` | Creates a new matter; status defaults to Open, billable defaults to true |
| `update_matter` | `matter_id`, plus any of `create_matter`'s optional fields | Updates one or more fields on an existing matter, including its stage and custom field values |

### Custom fields (2 tools)

| Tool | Inputs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `list_custom_fields` | `parent_type` (Matter/Contact), `include_deleted` | Lists the account's custom field definitions with their types, and for picklist fields their allowed options. Call this before reading or writing custom fields |
| `create_custom_field` | `name`, `parent_type` (Matter/Contact), `field_type`, `required`, `displayed`, `picklist_options` | Creates a new custom field definition. Use the returned `id` as `custom_field_id` in `create_matter` / `update_matter` to set its value |

### Matter stages (1 tool)

| Tool | Inputs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `list_matter_stages` | `practice_area_id` | Lists the account's matter stages (Pre-Suit, Discovery, Settlement and so on) grouped by practice area and in pipeline order. Call this before setting `matter_stage_id`. Clio can attach workflows and task lists to a stage; whether an API-driven stage change fires them is not verified, so confirm on one matter before relying on it |

### Contacts (2 tools)

| Tool | Inputs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `search_contacts` | `query`, `limit`, `page_token` | Searches contacts by name, email, or company; returns a paginated envelope with `total_count`, `has_more`, and `next_page_token`; pass the token back to fetch the next page |
| `get_contact` | `contact_id` | Returns full detail for a specific contact including all emails, phone numbers, addresses, and custom field values |

### Relationships (1 tool)

| Tool | Inputs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `list_matter_relationships` | `matter_id`, `limit`, `page_token` | Lists the contacts attached to a matter and the role each plays (co-counsel, expert, fact witness, opposing counsel) |

### Documents (3 tools)

| Tool | Inputs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `list_documents` | `matter_id`, `parent_id`, `query`, `limit`, `page_token` | Lists or full-text searches documents; at least one of `matter_id`, `parent_id`, or `query` is required; returns a paginated envelope with `total_count`, `has_more`, and `next_page_token` |
| `get_document` | `document_id` | Returns document metadata and a direct download URL |
| `upload_document` | `file_path`, `matter_id`, `name`, `content_type` | Uploads a local file to a matter using Clio's multipart S3 upload flow |

### Folders (3 tools)

| Tool | Inputs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `list_folders` | `matter_id`, `parent_id`, `query`, `limit`, `page_token` | Lists or full-text searches folders; at least one of `matter_id`, `parent_id`, or `query` is required; returns a paginated envelope with `total_count`, `has_more`, and `next_page_token` |
| `folder_exists` | `matter_id` or `parent_folder_id`, `name` | Checks whether a folder with the given exact name already exists; fully paginates and never relies on parent-type filtering, so it won't miss folders whose matter's document root is itself a Folder node |
| `create_folder` | `name`, `matter_id` or `parent_folder_id`, `if_not_exists` | Creates a folder at a matter's document root or under an existing folder; call `folder_exists` first to avoid duplicates |

---

## Resources

The connector also exposes two MCP resources: read-only content that compatible clients (including Claude Desktop) can surface automatically at the start of a session.

| Resource URI | What it contains |
|---|---|
| `clio://compliance/notice` | One-paragraph compliance reminder covering ABA Opinion 512, audit logging, and the attorney-review requirement for AI-generated content |
| `clio://auth/status` | Live authentication state: whether you are connected, your Clio user ID, and minutes until token expiry |

---

## Configuration reference

All settings are passed as environment variables (in your Claude Desktop config for stdio mode, or in the server's environment for HTTP mode). Only `CLIO_CLIENT_ID` and `CLIO_CLIENT_SECRET` are required in all modes; `MCP_BASE_URL` and `MCP_API_KEY` are additionally required in HTTP mode.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CLIO_CLIENT_ID` | Yes (BYO app) | — | Client ID from your Clio developer application. Not used, and not required, in the listed variant. |
| `CLIO_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes (BYO app) | — | Client Secret from your Clio developer application. Not used, and not required, in the listed variant. |
| `TOKEN_BROKER_URL` | Yes (listed variant only) | — | URL of Oktopeak's hosted token broker. Set this INSTEAD OF `CLIO_CLIENT_ID`/`CLIO_CLIENT_SECRET` when installed via the Clio App Directory. See [Listed / one-click install variant](#listed--one-click-install-variant-app-directory). |
| `TRANSPORT` | No | `http` | `stdio` or `http`. Defaults to `http` at v2.0.0; set to `stdio` for the pre-v2 behavior |
| `MCP_BASE_URL` | HTTP mode | (none) | Public base URL of this server (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:3000`). Used for the OAuth redirect |
| `PORT` | No | `3000` | HTTP listen port (HTTP mode only) |
| `MCP_API_KEY` | HTTP mode | (none) | Bearer token every client must send in the `Authorization` header. Required in HTTP mode, minimum 24 characters; the server refuses to start without it. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `MCP_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED` | No | `false` | Local development only. `true` lets the HTTP server start without `MCP_API_KEY` and prints a warning at startup. Never set this on a public host |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | No | auto-generated | Overrides OS keychain. Required only for CI/headless installs where no keychain is available. Must be a 64-character hex string. |
| `CLIO_REDIRECT_PORT` | No | `5678` | Local port for the OAuth callback (stdio mode). Change if 5678 is in use on your machine |
| `CLIO_REGION` | No | `us` | Clio data region: `us`, `eu`, `au`, or `ca`. Controls the default Clio API and OAuth base URLs. Set at Clio account creation; must match the server your firm logs in to. Any other value stops startup with an error |
| `CLIO_API_BASE` | No | `<region host>/api/v4` | Advanced override for the API base URL. Takes precedence over `CLIO_REGION` |
| `CLIO_AUTH_URL` | No | `<region host>/oauth/authorize` | Advanced override for the OAuth authorization endpoint |
| `CLIO_TOKEN_URL` | No | `<region host>/oauth/token` | Advanced override for the OAuth token endpoint |
| `READ_ONLY` | No | `false` | `true`, `1` or `yes` leaves the twelve write tools unregistered so Claude can read Clio but never change it. Works on both transports. See [Read-only mode](#read-only-mode) |

### Read-only mode

Set `READ_ONLY=true` and the connector never registers its twelve write tools (`create_matter`, `update_matter`, `create_custom_field`, `create_note`, `create_task`, `update_task`, `complete_task`, `create_calendar_entry`, `log_time_entry`, `create_activity`, `upload_document`, `create_folder`). They do not appear in Claude's tool list and a call to any of them is rejected by the server, so this is a server-side guarantee rather than a client-side prompt. The read tools, the auth tools and the audit export keep working. Without it, the only thing standing between Claude and a write is the approval prompt your MCP client shows, which belongs to the client, not to this connector.

For Claude Desktop, add it next to the other variables:

```json
"env": {
  "CLIO_CLIENT_ID": "...",
  "CLIO_CLIENT_SECRET": "...",
  "TRANSPORT": "stdio",
  "READ_ONLY": "true"
}
```

Every tool also carries MCP annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`) so clients that honour them can show which calls change data before you approve them.

### Clio regions

Clio hosts each firm's data in one of four regions. The region is chosen when the Clio account is created and the connector cannot change it; set `CLIO_REGION` to match the server your firm logs in to (the hostname in the browser address bar after login). Any value outside this list stops the connector at startup with an error naming the valid values. There is no silent fallback to the US endpoint.

| `CLIO_REGION` | Clio server | API base | OAuth authorize / token |
|---|---|---|---|
| `us` (default) | `app.clio.com` | `https://app.clio.com/api/v4` | `https://app.clio.com/oauth/authorize`, `https://app.clio.com/oauth/token` |
| `eu` | `eu.app.clio.com` | `https://eu.app.clio.com/api/v4` | `https://eu.app.clio.com/oauth/authorize`, `https://eu.app.clio.com/oauth/token` |
| `au` | `au.app.clio.com` | `https://au.app.clio.com/api/v4` | `https://au.app.clio.com/oauth/authorize`, `https://au.app.clio.com/oauth/token` |
| `ca` | `ca.app.clio.com` | `https://ca.app.clio.com/api/v4` | `https://ca.app.clio.com/oauth/authorize`, `https://ca.app.clio.com/oauth/token` |

---

## Audit log reference

Every tool call is recorded at `~/.clio-mcp/audit.log` in [JSONL](https://jsonlines.org) format (one JSON object per line). Example entry:

```json
{"timestamp":"2026-04-23T14:05:00.123Z","session_id":"3f2e9b1c-...","machine_ip":"192.168.1.42","tool":"get_matter","args":{"matter_id":4821},"outcome":"success","clio_user_id":"10023","matter_id":4821}
```

Each entry contains:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `timestamp` | ISO 8601 date and time of the call |
| `session_id` | Per-session UUID (stable for the life of a stdio process; one per HTTP session) |
| `machine_ip` | LAN IPv4 address of the host that logged the call. stdio mode only; inside a container the address means nothing, so it is left out |
| `user_id` | Caller identity when a hosting service runs the connector for several people. Absent in stdio and single-key HTTP mode |
| `request_id` | The host's request id, for matching an entry to its request log. Absent unless a host sets it |
| `tool` | Which tool Claude invoked |
| `args` | The arguments Claude passed, filtered by an allowlist (see below). Keys that were passed but are not on the list appear as `"[redacted]"` so the record still shows what was sent without containing it |
| `outcome` | `success`, `error`, or `not_found` |
| `error_message` | Present only when `outcome` is `error` |
| `clio_user_id` | The Clio user whose credentials were active |
| `matter_id` | Present for matter-specific queries |
| `result_count` | Present for list / export tools: number of records returned |

### What is never written to the log

Arguments are logged by allowlist, not by denylist. For every tool only ids, limits, dates, page tokens, enums and booleans are recorded verbatim; any other argument that was passed is replaced by `"[redacted]"`. Concretely, the log never contains: contact search queries (`search_contacts.query`), document searches (`list_documents.query`), note subjects or bodies, task names or descriptions, calendar summaries, descriptions or locations, matter descriptions or client references, time-entry or activity notes, file paths or file names, or the `list_users` name filter. The full table is `AUDIT_ARG_ALLOWLIST` in `src/utils/auditLog.ts`, and a test fails if a free-text key is ever added to it. Secret-named keys (`access_token`, `client_secret`, `password`, `token`) are masked everywhere, including inside nested objects.

The log file is append-only and never rotated or truncated by this software. To archive old entries, use your operating system's log rotation tools (`logrotate` on Linux/Mac). Hosts that embed the connector as a library can replace the file with their own store through `configureAudit({ sink })`; the record format is the same.

## Troubleshooting

**Claude says the Clio tool is not available**
Restart Claude Desktop fully (quit, do not just close the window). If the problem persists, check that the path in your config file is correct and that `build/index.js` exists in that folder.

**Authentication opens a browser but then nothing happens**
Make sure the redirect URI in your Clio developer application is set to exactly `http://127.0.0.1:5678/callback`. No trailing slash, no `localhost`; it must be `127.0.0.1`.

**"ENCRYPTION_KEY must be 64 hex chars" error**
This error appears when `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set in your environment but has the wrong length. Either correct or remove the value; if removed, the connector will use the key stored in your OS keychain (or generate one on first run).

**"Token file exists but decryption failed" warning**
This appears if the encryption key no longer matches the key used to encrypt the token file, for example if the keychain entry was deleted, you switched machines, or you changed `ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Run the `logout` tool in Claude and then `authenticate` again to re-create the token file with the current key.

**Logout does not clear the keychain entry**
The `logout` command removes your stored token file but not the encryption key from the OS keychain. For a complete credential wipe (for example, when transferring a machine), also remove the `clio-mcp / encryption-key` entry via your system's keychain manager: Keychain Access on macOS, Windows Credential Manager on Windows, or `secret-tool delete --label clio-mcp` on Linux.

**Port 5678 is already in use**
Add `"CLIO_REDIRECT_PORT": "5679"` to the `env` block in your Claude Desktop config, and update your Clio application's redirect URI to `http://127.0.0.1:5679/callback`.

**`list_custom_fields` returns 403 "User is forbidden from taking that action"**
Some accounts refuse custom field reads even when the connecting user is the account owner and the token works for everything else. When it happens, `/custom_fields.json` returns 403 and the custom field values expanded on matters and contacts come back with an id but no name, type or value, with no error at all. **We still have not reproduced this and the cause is not confirmed** — a live verification pass against a normally-permissioned BYOC developer account (September 2026) got a clean 200 with full data on every call, so this is specific to some other account or permission configuration, not the default path. It is consistent with the connecting Clio user's permission set not covering custom fields, so the first thing to try is having a Clio administrator confirm that user's custom field access and reconnecting (`logout`, then `authenticate`). If that is already in place, please [open an issue](https://github.com/oktopeak/clio-mcp/issues) with your Clio region and the exact response — we would like to get to the bottom of it.

**Custom fields come back with an `id` but `name`, `type` and `value` are `null`**
Same accounts, same unconfirmed cause, no error this time: Clio drops the expanded attributes silently. The response carries a `custom_fields_warning` when this happens. Treat those fields as unread rather than empty — they are not blank in Clio.

**A custom field disappears entirely instead of showing empty**
This is expected, not a bug: `clear: true` (on `update_matter`'s `custom_field_values`) deletes the value record itself, not just its value. A field that was simply never set still gets an empty placeholder from Clio (and from this connector) with a real id and `value: null`; a field that was explicitly cleared has no record at all until a new value is set, so both this connector's output and Clio's own UI show nothing for it. If you want a field to keep showing as blank, set an empty-equivalent value instead of clearing it.

**A picklist shows `display_value: null` and `label_unresolved: true`**
The connector could not put a name to the selected option, so it shows nothing rather than the internal option id. It first uses the label Clio sends with the value, then falls back to one read of your field definitions. Both failing usually means the same permission problem as above.

**A response carries a `fields_warning`**
Clio rejected part of the field selection, so the request was retried without the optional expansions. The response is real but incomplete, and the missing fields are not necessarily empty in Clio. Please report it with the quoted message.

## Using the connector as a library

Everything the two transports use is exported from `@oktopeak/clio-mcp/lib`, so a service can run the same 26 tools inside its own server: its own login, its own token store, its own audit store. The public npm package and the local install are unchanged; this is the seam a hosting service builds on.

```ts
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import {
  registerAllTools, runWithSessionContext, configureAudit,
  buildClioAuthorizeUrl, exchangeClioCode, refreshClioTokens, fetchClioWhoAmI,
} from "@oktopeak/clio-mcp/lib";

// Once at startup: send audit entries to your store instead of ~/.clio-mcp/audit.log.
configureAudit({ sink: myAuditSink });

// Per request: register the tools you want to expose, then run the MCP request
// inside a session context that knows who the caller is and how to get a Clio token.
const server = new McpServer({ name: "my-host", version: "1.0.0" });
registerAllTools(server, { readOnly: false, auth: "none", exclude: ["upload_document"], complianceNotice: "..." });
await runWithSessionContext(
  {
    sessionId: requestId,
    userId, clioUserId, requestId,
    getAccessToken: () => tokenStore.validAccessToken(userId),   // refresh with refreshClioTokens() as needed
    getTokens: () => tokenStore.get(userId),
    storeTokens: (t) => tokenStore.set(userId, t),
    clearTokens: () => tokenStore.clear(userId),
  },
  () => transport.handleRequest(req, res, req.body)
);
```

The Clio OAuth functions take explicit credentials and a region (`buildClioAuthorizeUrl`, `exchangeClioCode`, `refreshClioTokens`, `fetchClioWhoAmI`, plus `generateCodeVerifier` / `deriveCodeChallenge` for PKCE); nothing in the library reads `CLIO_CLIENT_ID` from the environment. Outside stdio mode the tools refuse to run without a session context, so a host can never fall back to a shared token file by accident. Types ship with the package (`build/lib.d.ts`); the exported surface is pinned by `src/__tests__/lib.test.ts`.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests welcome. If you run into a Clio API edge case this connector does not handle cleanly, open an issue with the scenario and an example request. If you add a tool, register its name in `src/tools/index.ts` (`TOOL_META`, and `WRITE_TOOLS` if it changes Clio data) so the read-only gate and the annotations cover it; `registry.test.ts` fails otherwise.
